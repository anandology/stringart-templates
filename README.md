# String Art Templates

A collection of designs in SVG format for making laser-cut **string art templates**.

I created these templates for making my own String Art Starter and Advanced Kits, and I've shared them here for anyone to use and adapt.

## Products & Kits

I use these designs to create my own laser‑cut string templates for making:
- **String Art Starter Kit** – a simple kit for introducing people to string art
- **String Art Advanced Kit** – a more challenging kit for making more intricate patterns
